### Shell environment set up for builds. ###

You can now run 'bitbake <target>'

Common targets are the known poky targets as well as images defined in meta-dumpling:

    tq-image-generic[-debug]
    tq-image-small[-debug]
    tq-image-weston[-debug]
    core-image-minimal
    core-image-full-cmdline
    core-image-sato
    core-image-weston
    meta-toolchain
    meta-ide-support

You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86'.

Other commonly useful commands are:
 - 'devtool' and 'recipetool' handle common recipe tasks
 - 'bitbake-layers' handles common layer tasks
 - 'oe-pkgdata-util' handles common target package tasks
